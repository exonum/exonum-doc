This is the documentation repo for the Exonum platform. It contains source files
used to build the documentation displayed on the [Exonum
website](http://exonum.com/doc/).

The Exonum documentation is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
and uses [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate HTML from sources.
You can read about Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
or [other](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
[places](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/).

## Contributing

In order to contribute, fork this repository, make some changes, and then submit
them as a pull request. Simple!

Notice that the repository uses a set of [linters][wiki:lint] to check possible
problems with the contributed documents:

- [markdownlint][mdl] is used to lint Markdown files. Please see
  [the rules list][mdl-rules] to fix possible problems with this linter
- [html5validator][html5validator] is used for checking problems with the
  generated HTML pages
- [linkchecker][linkchecker] is used to find missing links

You can set up these tools locally (see the `install` step in [the Travis config](.travis.yml)
for more details) and run them using the `./misc/lint.sh` script with `md`, `html`,
`links`, or `all` arguments.

### Page Meta

During the build process, `mkdocs` gathers meta information for each page, which
is then used to provide page summary on social media, for search engines, etc.
The main meta information of interest is the page description. By default,
it is equal to the first paragraph of the page. You can override this default
by providing an explicit description on the very top of the page
with a front matter formatting:

```markdown
---
description: 1-3 sentence description of the page
---
# Page Title

Page contents...
```

Similarly, you can redefine the displayed page title by providing a `title` property
in the front matter. The site-wide “Exonum Documentation” suffix will be added
automatically.

**Note.** Although it looks like YAML front matter in [Jekyll][jekyll]
and some other static site generators, `mkdocs` actually uses [a simpler parser][mkdocs-meta]
for the front matter. Be advised for possible discrepancies.

## Build Instructions

It is a good idea to preview your changes locally before sending a pull request. 

### Installation

First, you need to install [Python](http://python.org/) and [python-pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/).
Then, install the `mkdocs` theme together with its dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may use [`requirements.lock`](requirements.lock) instead of [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
in order to get repeatable builds.

To install linters, use

```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

`markdownlint` needs to be installed separately, as it is written in Ruby and uses
`gem` as the package manager.

### Viewing Documents Locally

In order to run a local web server serving docs, use:

```
mkdocs serve
```

The web server will be available on [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

To generate HTML files from the Markdown source files, use:

```
mkdocs build
```

The generated pages will be available in the **site/** directory.
