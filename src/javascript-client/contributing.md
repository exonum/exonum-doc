# Contributing guidelines

The contributing to the [exonum-client][github] is based on the same principles and rules as
[the contributing to exonum-core](../contributing).

## Coding standards

The coding standards are described in the [`.eslintrc`][github:eslintrc] file.

To help developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs
we used [`.editorconfig`][github:editorconfig] configuration file.

## Test coverage

All functions must include relevant unit tests.
This applies to both of adding new features and fixing existed bugs.
