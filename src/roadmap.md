# Exonum Roadmap

Exonum is an open source software, so there is no particular concept of
“Exonum core developers” (see [contributing guide](contributing)). However,
there're preferred directions of the development. These include maintainers
opinions, natural improvements and a will to correspond to good practices.

## Overall direction

## Interoperability

## Java binding

## Object related mapping
