# Merkelized List

[**Merkelized list**](../architecture/merkledb.md#prooflistindex) is a version
of a typed list that supports compact proofs of existence for its elements using
Merkle trees. Merkelized lists in Exonum are designed as classic binary Merkle trees
within the persistence module, but can also be viewed as append-only lists
by [client](../architecture/clients.md)
and [service](../architecture/services.md) developers.

A [Merkle tree][wiki-merkelized-list] (aka hash tree or Tiger tree hash)
is a [tree][wiki-tree] in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash
of the labels or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes. Hash trees are
a generalization of hash lists and chains. Merkle trees include both benefits of

1. **Trees**: operations on elements (appending a new element, getting an
  element) take `O(log N)` operations, where `N` is number of elements
  (for example, transactions)
2. **Hashes**: verification of the (blockchain) copies.

## Motivation and Usage

In the blockchain as in various other distributed and [peer-to-peer][wiki:p2p]
systems, data verification is very important because the same data
exists in multiple locations. Thus, if a piece of data is changed in one
location, it is important that the same data changes are processed everywhere
in the same way.

It is time consuming and computationally expensive to check the
entirety of each part whenever a system wants to verify data. This is why
Merkle trees are used. Basically, the use of Merkle trees limits
the amount of data being sent over a network as much as possible.
Instead of sending an entire file
over the network, it is possible just send a hash of the file to see if it matches.

Currently, the main uses of Merkle trees are in peer-to-peer networks such
as [Tor][tor] and [Bitcoin][bitcoin]. The usage of Merkle tree for blockchains
(including Bitcoin and Exonum) is twofold:

- Minimization of the data transfer during the blockchain state agreement
  during *Precommit* phase of the
  [consensus algorithm](../architecture/consensus.md)
- Possibility of [light clients](../architecture/clients.md)
  implementation.

## `ProofListIndex` Storage Specification

Operator `||` below stands for concatenation. Function `hash(arg)` below
stands for [SHA-256][sha-256] hash of byte array `arg`.

### Persistence

The internal representation of a Merkle tree is organized by utilizing 2 integer
parameters as a key for each element: `height` and `index`.

!!! note
    To distinguish values from different lists in Exonum, an additional prefix is
    used for every key. Consult
    [*MerkleDB*](../architecture/merkledb.md) for more details.

Each Merkle tree element is addressed by an 8-byte `key = height || index`,
where:

- `height <= 56` is height of element in the tree, where `height = 0`
  denotes a leaf. `height` is represented as 8 bits (i.e., 1 byte)
- `index` is index of element at the given height consisting of the other 56 bits
  (7 bytes)
- `index` are serialized within `key` as [big-endian][wiki:big-endian] values

!!! note
    This storage design means that the maximum supported number of elements
    in a `ProofListIndex` is `2 ** 56` (approximately `7.2e16`),
    rather than `2 ** 64`. We consider this amount sufficient
    for practical applications.

The elements of the underlying list are stored in `(height = 0, index)`
cells, where `index` is in interval `[0, list.len())` and
`list.len()` is the number of leaves in the tree (or, equivalently, the
number of elements in the underlying list).

Hash of a tree leaf is stored in `(height = 1, index)`.
It corresponds to the tree leaf stored in `(height = 0, index)`.

Some of the rightmost intermediate nodes may have a single child; it is not
required that the obtained tree is full binary. Appending an element to the
list corresponds to writing it to the cell `(0, list.len())` and updating
`O(log list.len())` nodes of the tree with `height > 0`.

A node at `(height > 1, index)` stores hashes of 1 or 2 child nodes.

- If both `(height - 1, index * 2)` and `(height - 1, index * 2 + 1)`
  nodes are present, the node `(height, index)` has 2 children hashes.
- If only `(height - 1, index * 2)` node is present, the
  node at `(height, index)` has single child hash.

`max_height` is the minimal height at which only a single hash is stored at
`index = 0`.

- `max_height = pow + 1`, where `pow` is the smallest integer such that
  `2^pow >= list.len()`
- `(max_height, 0)` defines *the root hash* of the Merkle tree.

An example of key–value mappings in database:

Key | Height | Index | Value
------------|-------------:|-------------:|-------------
**00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **FF** |  0 | 255 | serialized value
**04** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **05** |  1 | 5   | hash
**0C** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **00** **0A** |  3 | 10  | hash

### Logical Representation

Below is an illustration of the logical representation of a Merkle tree,
containing 6 values `v0...v5`:

## Computing List Hash

Hashing a Merkelized list consists of two logical operations:

1. Computing the *root hash* of the tree
2. Computing the *list hash* using the root hash and the list length.

Since the second component is easier, we will define it first.
Given the list length `len` and the `root_hash` of a Merkle tree corresponding
to the list, the list hash is defined as

```text
h = sha-256( HashTag::ListNode || u64_LE(len) || root_hash )
```

Here,

- `HashTag::ListNode = 2` is a tag separating lists from other hashed objects.
  (Here and elsewhere, tags are serialized as a single byte.)
- `u64_LE` is an 8-byte little-endian serialization of an integer.

### Computing Root Hash

Let `T(height, index)` be a value at tree node for element `index` at height
`height`. Elements `T(0, index)` contain serialized values of the underlying list.
Elements `T(height, index)` for `height > 0` are hashes corresponding the following
rules.

#### Rule 1. Empty Tree

Root hash of an empty tree is defined as 32 zero bytes.

#### Rule 2. Bottommost Hashes

Hash of a value contained in `(height = 0, index)` is defined as

```text
T(1, index) = hash(HashTag::Blob || T(0, index)),
```

where `HashTag::Blob = 0` is a domain separation tag for values.

#### Rule 3. Nodes with Two Children

If `height > 1` and both nodes `T(height - 1, index * 2)` and
`T(height - 1, index * 2 + 1)` exist, then

```text
T(height, index) = hash(
    HashTag::ListBranchNode ||
    T(height - 1, index * 2) ||
    T(height - 1, index * 2 + 1)
),
```

where `HashTag::ListBranchNode = 1` is a domain separation tag
for intermediate Merkle tree nodes.

#### Rule 4. Nodes with Single Child

If `height > 1`, node `T(height - 1, index * 2)` exists and
node `(height - 1, index * 2 + 1)` is absent in the tree, then

```text
T(height, index) = hash(
    HashTag::ListBranchNode ||
    T(height - 1, index * 2)
).
```

#### Getting Root Hash

```text
root_hash = T(max_height, 0),
```

where `max_height` is the tree height as defined previously.

## Merkle Tree Proofs

**Proofs** allow to efficiently and compactly verify that one or more
elements are present at specific indexes in a Merkelized list.
The proof also commits to the list length, so that it can be used
to prove that the list *does not* contain elements with certain indexes.

One could think of proofs as of Merkle trees pruning. That is, a proof is
produced by “collapsing” some intermediate nodes in the Merkle tree.
Another point of view – from the light client perspective – is that a proof
is essentially a limited view of a list, for which the Merkle tree is
constructed. This view allows to calculate the hash of the whole list and
proves that specific elements are present in the list.

### Format

The proofs returned by the Exonum storage engine are non-recursive,
thus minimizing overhead (e.g., heap allocations) and allowing to use
them in environments not allowing recursive data types. A proof
consists of three principal parts:

- Entries proven to exist in the list (i.e., values together with their indexes)
- Intermediate tree nodes (i.e., `T(height, ..)` values at `height > 0`)
  that together with entries allow to restore `root_hash` of the Merkle tree
  for the list
- List length

Entries and/or intermediate tree nodes may be empty.

??? note "Protobuf spec"
    ```protobuf
    message ListProof {
      repeated HashedEntry proof = 1;
      repeated ListProofEntry entries = 2;
      uint64 length = 3;
    }

    // Represents list key and corresponding hash value.
    message HashedEntry {
      ProofListKey key = 1;
      exonum.crypto.Hash hash = 2;
    }

    // Index of the list element and its value.
    message ListProofEntry {
      uint64 index = 1;
      bytes value = 2;
    }

    // Represents list node position in the merkle tree.
    message ProofListKey {
      uint64 index = 1;
      uint32 height = 2;
    }
    ```

??? note "TypeScript spec of JSON serialization"
    ```typescript
    interface ListProof<V> {
      proof: HashedEntry[],
      // first element in a tuple is element index,
      // the second one is the JSON-serialized value
      entries: [number, V][],
      length: number,
    }

    interface HashedEntry {
      height: number,
      index: number,
      hash: string, // 64 hex digits
    }
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable  -->

### Proof Verification

While validating the proof, a client restores `root_hash` and
computes the list hash. Depending on the use case, the list hash
can be compared to a trusted reference or participate in further aggregation.

Restoring `root_hash` can be performed as per [above section](#computing-root-hash):

1. Compute `T(height = 1, ..)` for entries according to [rule 2](#rule-2-bottommost-hashes).
  Let `layer` denote the obtained values.
2. Compute Merkle tree height `max_height` given length of the list.
3. For `height = 1, 2, ..., max_height - 1` perform steps 4–5.
4. Combine `layer` with intermediate tree nodes from the proof at the same height
  into a single list, `combined_layer`.
5. “Lift” the nodes in `combined_layer` to the next height according to
  [rules 3](#rule-3-nodes-with-two-children) and [4](#rule-4-nodes-with-single-child).
  Assign `layer` to be the resulting list.
6. `root_hash = layer[0]`. At this point, `layer` must contain exactly one item.

To make the above procedure more effective, the proofs returned by MerkleDB
have entries ordered by increasing index and intermediate nodes ordered by
increasing `(height, index)` tuple. This allows to combine layers on step 4
and lift them on step 5 more effectively. If the client wants to take
the ordering into account during verification, the client must check it
in advance (which takes linear time w.r.t. the proof size).
