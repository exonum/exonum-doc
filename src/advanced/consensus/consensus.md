# Consensus in Exonum

Generally, a [consensus algorithm][wiki:consensus] is a process of
obtaining an agreed result by a group of participants. In Exonum the
consensus algorithm is used to agree on the list of transactions
in blocks added to the blockchain. The other goal of the algorithm is to ensure
that the results of the transaction execution are interpreted in the same way
by all nodes in the blockchain network.

The consensus algorithm in Exonum is based on the [algorithm proposed in
Tendermint][tendermint_consensus].

## Assumptions

Not all the nodes in the blockchain network may be actively involved in
the consensus algorithm. Rather, there is a special role for active consensus
participants â€“ *validators* or *validator nodes*.
For example, in a [consortium blockchain][public_and_private_blockchains]
validators could be controlled by the companies participating in the consortium.

The consensus algorithm must operate in the presence of faults, i.e., when
participants in the network may behave abnormally. The Exonum consensus algorithm
assumes the worst; it operates under the assumption that any individual node
or even a group of nodes in the blockchain network can crash or can be compromised
by a resourceful adversary (say, a hacker or a corrupt administator). This
threat model is known in computer science as [Byzantine faults][wiki:bft];
correspondingly, the Exonum consensus algorithm is Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT).

From the computer science perspective, the Exonum consensus algorithm takes
usual assumptions:

- Validator nodes are assumed to be [partially synchronous][partial_synchrony],
  i.e., their computation performances do not differ much
- The network is partially synchronous, too. That is, all messages are delivered
  in the finite time which, however, is unknown in advance
- Each validator has an access to a local **stopwatch** to determine time intervals.
  On the other hand, there is no global synchronized time in the system
- Validators can be identified with the public-key cryptography; correspondingly,
  the communication among validators is authenticated

The same assumptions are used in [PBFT][pbft] (the most well-known BFT consensus)
and its successors.

Other assumptions:

- +2/3 means "more than 2/3", and -1/3 means less than one third.

- A set of +2/3 votes from _prevote_ state `(H, R)` will be called
_Proof-of-Lock_ (_PoL_). Nodes should store PoL. The node can have no more than
one stored PoL.

- We will say that *PoL is greater than recorded one* (has a higher priority), in
cases when 1) there is no PoL recorded 2) the recorded PoL corresponds to a
proposal with a smaller round number. So PoLs are [partially
ordered][partial_ordering].

- Some ordered numbering of validators (validator id) from 0 to N-1 exists and
it is known to all network members. When moving to a new height, the validator
number may change due to a change in the list of validators.

- Nodes receive and exchange among themselves transactions that need to be added
to the blockchain. Each node has a set of transactions that have not yet been
added to the blockchain. This set will be called **pool of unconfirmed
transactions** . In general, the pools of unconfirmed transactions are different
for different nodes. If necessary, the nodes can request unknown transactions
from other nodes. We will also refer to the transaction added to the blockchain
in one of the previous blocks as **committed**.

## Algorithm overview

The process of reaching consensus on the next block (at the blockchain height `H`)
consists of several **rounds**, numbered from 1\. The first round starts once the
validator commits the block at height `H - 1`. The onsets of rounds are determined
by a fixed timetable: rounds start after regular intervals. As there is no global time,
rounds may start at a different time for different validators.

When the round number `R` comes, the previous rounds are not completed.
That is, round `R` means that the validator can process messages
related to a round with a number no greater than `R`.
The current state of a validator can be described as a tuple `(H, R)`.
The `R` part may differ among validators, but the height `H` is usually the same.
If a specific validator is lagging (e.g., during its initial synchronization, or if
it was switched off for some time), its height may be lower.
In this case, the validator can request missing blocks from
other validators and full nodes in order to quickly synchronize with the rest
of the network.

To put it *very* simply, rounds proceed as follows:

1. Each round has a *leader node*. The round leader offers a *proposal*
  for the next block and broadcasts it accross the network. The logic of selecting
  the leader node is described [in a separate algorithm](leader-election.md)
2. Validators may vote for the proposal by broadcasting a *prevote* message.
  A prevote means that the validator has been able to parse the proposal
  and has all transactions specified in it
3. After a validator has collected enough prevotes from a supermajority
  of other validators, it applies transactions specified in the prevoted proposal, 
  and broadcasts a *precommit* message. This message contains the result of the proposal
  execution in the form of [a new state hash](../storage.md)
  The precommit expresses that the sender is ready to commit the corresponding
  proposed block to the blockchain, but needs to see what the other validators
  have to say on the matter just to be sure
4. Finally, if a validator has collected a supermajority of precommits with
  the same state hash for the same proposal, the proposed block is committed
  to the blockchain.

In reality, the algorithm is more complex. It uses *requests* to obtain unknown
information from the other nodes. Such requests are sent to nodes that signal
presence of unknown information (for example, messages are sent from heights
greater than the current node height in the case of a lagging node). Sending and
processing of such messages is algorithmized (**TODO:** insert link to request
algorithm). The algorithm for sending requests is an integral part of the
consensus algorithm.

Also, consensus algorithm can process any type of message (message types are
listed below) at any time.

Validators exchange messages. The consensus algorithm uses several types
of messages:

  1. _Propose_ - a set of transactions to include in the block (message includes
  not whole transactions but only transaction hashes). If the behavior is
  correct, it is sent only by the leader node of the round.
  2. _Prevote_ - voting message, indicating that the node has a correctly formed
  proposal and all the transactions specified in it. To be distributed by all
  nodes.
  3. _Precommit_ - message expressing readiness to include the next block into
  blockchain. To be distributed by all nodes.
  4. _Status_ - information message about the current height. It is sent with a
  periodicity written in the `status_timeout` variable (consensus parameter).
  5. _Block_ - message containing a block (in the meaning of blockchain) and a
  set of _precommit_ messages that allowed that block to be accepted. To be sent
  on request.
  6. _Request_ - request message for receiving certain information using
  *requests algorithm*.

In comparison with other BFT algorithms, the consensus algorithm in Exonum has
such distinctive features:

- Rounds have a fixed start time but they do not have a definite end
time (round ends when the next block is received). This reduces the effect of
network delays.

- _Propose_ message includes only transaction hashes. Transactions are included
into _Block_ message and executed only at the **_LOCK_** stage. This ensures
system asynchrony.

- *Requests algorithm* allows node to restore any consensus info from the other
nodes.

## Node states overview

The order of states in the proposed algorithm is as follows:

```
Commit -> (Round)+ -> Commit -> ...
```

So on the timeline, these states look like this (for one of the
validator nodes):

```
Commit: |  H  |                       | H+1 |               | H+2 |                              ...
Round1: |     | R1                    |     | R1            |     | R1                           ...
Round2: |          | R2               |          | R2       |          | R2                      ...
Round3: |               | R3          |               | R3  |               | R3                 ...
Round4: |                    | R4     |                    ||                    | R4            ...
...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->  Time
```

Note that rounds have a fixed start time but they do not have a definite end
time (they end when the next block is received). This differs from common
behavior of partially synchoronous consensus algorithms, in which rounds have
a definite conclusion (i.e., messages generated during the round `R`
must be processed only during the round `R`).
