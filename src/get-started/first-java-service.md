# First Exonum Java Service Tutorial

<!-- cspell:ignore Lorean, Intelli, testnet -->

This tutorial is aimed at beginners in Exonum Java. It is an introduction
into service development in Java. You will learn how to create an Exonum service,
start a test network, and deploy your service in it. This introductory
tutorial, however, omits some important to real-world services topics,
like authorization, or proofs of authenticity for service data, or testing,
but gives a solid foundation to learn about that in subsequent materials.

The full tutorial code is available in our [Git repository][car-registry-git].

[car-registry-git]: https://github.com/exonum/exonum-java-binding/tree/ejb/v0.10.0/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry

## Prerequisites

It is recommended to read an [introduction into Exonum](what-is-exonum.md)
and its [design overview](design-overview.md) before proceeding
with this tutorial. The reader is expected to be familiar with the Java
programming language.

The following software must be installed:

- JDK 11
- [Apache Maven 3.6+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Exonum Java 0.10](./java-binding.md#installation)
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
- An editor or IDE for Java.

## Service Overview

Blockchains are often used to implement secure registries. In this tutorial,
we will implement a vehicle registry. The registry will keep a record of
vehicles; and allow adding new vehicles and changing their owner.
It will also provide REST API to query the registry.

## Service Implementation

### Creating a Project

#### Generate from Template

First, open a terminal and run the following command to create a new service
project with a Maven archetype:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.exonum.binding \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=exonum-java-binding-service-archetype \
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.10.0 \
    -DgroupId=com.example.car \
    -DartifactId=car-registry \
    -Dversion=1.0.0
```

We use the following values for service project properties:

- `com.example.car` for `groupId`
- `car-registry` for `artifactId`
- `1.0.0` for `version`.

Verify that the project has been generated correctly and the dependencies
are installed by running its integration tests:

```shell
cd car-registry/
mvn verify
```

You shall see in the output that `com.example.car.MyServiceIntegrationTest`
completed successfully and the build passes.

??? fail "Getting a build error?"
    If you get `java.lang.LinkageError` in the test, check that Exonum Java
    is installed correctly. Particularly, check that `EXONUM_HOME` environment
    variable is set to the Exonum Java installation location.
    See the [installation instructions](java-binding.md#installation)
    for details.

    If you get a compilation error `invalid flag: --release`, Maven likely
    uses Java 8 to compile the project. Check:

    - That the Java on `PATH` is 11 or above: `java -version`
    - That the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is unset;
      or points to a JDK installation 11 or above: `echo "$JAVA_HOME"`

#### Skeleton Project Overview

The generated project is a mere "skeleton". It consists of two modules:

- `car-registry-messages` for the definitions of service messages.
- `car-registry-service` for the service business logic.

### Declare Service Persistent Data

!!! tip
    Import the project into your IDE if you haven't already.

Our vehicle registry needs to store the following information about
a vehicle:

- An identifier
- A manufacturer (e.g., "Ford")
- A model (e.g., "Focus")
- Its owner (e.g., "Dave").

Let's define the car object. We will use a protobuf message, because
Exonum stores objects in a serialized form. Create a `vehicle.proto`
in `car-registry-messages`
(`car-registry-messages/src/main/proto/example/vehicle`):

<!--codeinclude-->
[vehicle.proto](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-messages/src/main/proto/example/vehicle/vehicle.proto)
<!--/codeinclude-->

Run `mvn generate-sources` to compile the message.

---

Next, we will define the persistent data of our service. Exonum Services define
their persistent data in a [_schema_](../glossary.md#data-schema):
a set of named, persistent, typed collections, also known as indexes.
Our project already has a template schema `MySchema` — navigate to it.

The `MySchema` has a field `access` of type [`Prefixed`][prefixed], initialized in
its constructor. It is a database access object, which allows to access
the indexes of this service.

[prefixed]: https://exonum.com/doc/api/java-binding/0.10.0/com/exonum/binding/core/storage/database/Prefixed.html

To keep a registry of vehicles indexed by their IDs, we will use a `ProofMap`
index with `String` keys and `Vehicle` values, named `vehicles`.
The `ProofMap` ensures that the data is the same
on each node in the network.
We will expose our index through a factory method — a method that provides
access to the `ProofMap`. Use [`Access.getProofMap`][access-get-proof-map] method
to access the `vehicles` index:

[access-get-proof-map]: https://exonum.com/doc/api/java-binding/0.10.0/com/exonum/binding/core/storage/database/Access.html#getProofMap(com.exonum.binding.core.storage.indices.IndexAddress,com.exonum.binding.common.serialization.Serializer,com.exonum.binding.common.serialization.Serializer)

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MySchema.java)
inside_block:ci-vehicles
<!--/codeinclude-->

Notice that the `access.getProofMap` accepts three parameters:

- an index _address_ identifying this index in the blockchain
- two serializers: one for keys and one for values. Exonum needs the serializers
  to convert objects into bytes and back, as it stores the objects as bytes.
  For `String` keys, we use a standard serializer. For `Vehicle`s, which
  are Protocol Buffers messages, we use a corresponding serializer for messages
  of `Vehicle` type.

!!! tip
    As the [`StandardSerializers.protobuf`][protobuf-serializer] uses reflection
    to look up the needed methods in the message class, it is recommended
    to instantiate a protobuf serializer once for each type
    and keep it in a `static` field, e.g.:

    ```java
    private static final Serializer<Vehicle> VEHICLE_SERIALIZER =
        StandardSerializers.protobuf(Vehicle.class);
    ```

[protobuf-serializer]: https://exonum.com/doc/api/java-binding/0.10.0/com/exonum/binding/common/serialization/StandardSerializers.html#protobuf(java.lang.Class)

??? fail "Cannot import `Vehicle` class?"
    In some IDEs, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, it might be needed to manually
    mark `car-registry-messages/target/generated-sources/protobuf/java`
    directory as "Generated Sources Root" to be able to import the generated
    classes:

    1. Open context menu (right click on the directory)
    2. "Mark Directory As" > "Generated Sources Root"

Compile the project:

```shell
mvn compile
```

### Service Transactions

Our service needs two operations updating its state:

- Add a new vehicle entry to the registry
- Transfer the ownership over the vehicle to another user.

Modifying operations in Exonum are called [_transactions_](../glossary.md#transaction).
Transactions are implemented as methods in a service class — a class implementing
[`Service`][service-interface] interface. A transaction method must be annotated
with [`@Transaction`][transaction-annotation] annotation.

[service-interface]: https://exonum.com/doc/api/java-binding/0.10.0/com/exonum/binding/core/service/Service.html
[transaction-annotation]: https://exonum.com/doc/api/java-binding/0.10.0/com/exonum/binding/core/transaction/Transaction.html

Our project already has a template service named `MyService`.

#### Add Vehicle Transaction

First, let's define the transaction arguments. As Exonum expects transaction
arguments in a serialized form, we will define the arguments as a protobuf
message.

Add a new file `transactions.proto` in `car-registry-messages`
(`car-registry-messages/src/main/proto/example/vehicle`).

Then add the message definition of the _Add Vehicle_ transaction:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-messages/src/main/proto/example/vehicle/transactions.proto)
inside_block:ci-add-vehicle
<!--/codeinclude-->

Compile the message:

```shell
mvn generate-sources
```

---

Next, let's write the transaction method. Navigate to `MyService`
and add the following method:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MyService.java)
inside_block:ci-add-vehicle
<!--/codeinclude-->

The annotation accepts an integral _transaction ID_: an identifier of
the transaction that service clients use to invoke it.

The method accepts `AddVehicle` class: an auto-generated class from our
protobuf definition. It also accepts the `ExecutionContext` allowing
the transaction to access the database.

The transaction implementation uses the service data schema `MySchema`
to access the service data.

Note that the transaction throws an [`ExecutionException`](java-binding.md#exceptions)
in case of a precondition failure: in this case, an attempt to add a vehicle
with an existing ID. When Exonum catches an `ExecutionException`, it rolls back
any changes made by this transaction and records its execution status
as erroneous.

Compile the code:

```shell
mvn compile
```

#### Transfer the Ownership Transaction

Let's add the second transaction which will change the owner of a vehicle
in the registry. It needs as its arguments the ID of the vehicle;
and a new owner.

Navigate to `transactions.proto` and add a message with the arguments:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-messages/src/main/proto/example/vehicle/transactions.proto)
block:ChangeOwner
<!--/codeinclude-->

Compile the message:

```shell
mvn generate-sources
```

Then navigate to the service `MyService` and add an implementation with
appropriate constants:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MyService.java)
inside_block:ci-change-owner
<!--/codeinclude-->

This transaction is similar to the first one.

Notice how an update of the `owner` field in an existing `Vehicle` value
is performed. It creates a builder from the existing object with
`Vehicle.newBuilder(templateVehicle)` method, updates the field, and builds
a new object.

Compile the code:

```shell
mvn compile
```

#### Service Constructor

Finally, we will add a _service constructor_ — a service method
that is invoked once when the service is instantiated. We will use it
to populate our registry with some test data.

It is implemented as the `Service#initialize` method. By default, it has
an empty implementation in the interface, hence it is not yet present
in `MyService`.

Override the `Service#initialize` with the following implementation:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MyService.java)
inside_block:ci-initialize
<!--/codeinclude-->

Note that this method delegates to the `addVehicle` transaction method
we have added earlier.

!!! success
    In this section we have learned how to implement operations modifying
    the blockchain state: transactions and the service constructor.
    There are more operations of such type described in [Service Hooks](../architecture/services.md#hooks)
    section.

### Service API

In the previous section we have implemented operations modifying the blockchain
state. Applications usually also need a means to _query_ data. In this section,
we will add an operation to retrieve a vehicle entry by its ID
from the registry. This operation will be exposed through REST API.

#### Find Vehicle Service Operation

First, we need to add a query operation to the Service:

<!--codeinclude-->
[MyService.findVehicle](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MyService.java)
inside_block:ci-find-vehicle
<!--/codeinclude-->

Although this query method will be invoked by our code, hence the signature
we use may be arbitrary, the signature is similar to the transaction methods:
it takes the operation arguments and the context (here: `String` ID
and `BlockchainData` context).

#### API Controller

Next, we will add a class implementing the REST API of the service.
It will expose our "find vehicle" operation as a `GET` method.

Create a new `ApiController` class:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/ApiController.java)
block:ApiController
<!--/codeinclude-->

The `ApiController` needs a `MyService` object to query data; and
a `Node` object to obtain the needed context: `BlockchainData`.
It uses [Vert.x Web][vertx-web] to define the endpoints.

[vertx-web]: https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_basic_vert_x_web_concepts

!!! note
    We encode the response in Protocol Buffers binary format for brevity.
    The controller may encode it in any suitable format (e.g., JSON).

Finally, connect the controller to the service. `MyService` already has
an empty `createPublicApiHandlers` method, modify it to have:

<!--codeinclude-->
[MyService.createPublicApiHandlers](../../code-examples/java/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry/car-registry-service/src/main/java/com/example/car/MyService.java)
inside_block:ci-createPublicApiHandlers
<!--/codeinclude-->

!!! success
    That's it with the service implementation! Package
    the [_service artifact_](../glossary.md#artifact)
    and run the integration tests:

    ```shell
    mvn verify
    ```

    and then proceed to the next section, where we will test its operation.

## Test Network

Let's now launch a test network in which we can see our service operation.
Our project already has a script launching a test network with a single
validator node: `start-testnet.sh`.

Run the script:

```shell
chmod 744 start-testnet.sh # Allow the script execution, needed once
./start-testnet.sh
```

When you see messages like the following, the network is active:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```text
[2020-03-05T10:36:24Z INFO  exonum_node::consensus] COMMIT ====== height=4, proposer=0, round=1, committed=0, pool=0, hash=43ac20f8b...
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Open a separate shell session and check the active services:

```shell
# You may pipe the response into `jq` to pretty-print it, if you have it
# installed:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/services/supervisor/services # | jq
```

You can see in the output the lists of deployed _service artifacts_ and
_service instances_.
However, the network has neither our _service artifact_ nor
an _instance_ of our service. That is natural, because the service
must be registered in the network first, and then it may be instantiated.

### Service Instantiation

#### Install the Java Launcher

To register a service artifact that we built previously in the network,
we will need `exonum-launcher` tool. It is a Python application which we
recommend to install in a [virtual environment][python-venv]:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

[python-venv]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

Then install the `exonum-launcher` with the Java runtime support:

```shell
pip install exonum-launcher-java-plugins
```

Check it works:

```shell
python -m exonum_launcher --help
```

#### Start a Test Instance

Next, we shall place the service artifact into an artifacts directory
of the node: `testnet/artifacts`.

```shell
# Create the artifacts directory
mkdir testnet/artifacts
# Copy the artifact
cp car-registry-service/target/car-registry-service-1.0.0-artifact.jar \
   testnet/artifacts/
```

<!--
TODO: Shall the _node_ (= Java runtime) create an artifacts directory if one
does not exist already? If it shall, won't it cause problems if we launch
several nodes locally with the same (not yet existing) artifacts directory?

It is somewhat annoying to always have to create the dir :-)

Possibly, we can use ./artifacts (outside testnet/) so that it does not
get cleaned by either ./start-testnet.sh or mvn clean.
-->

<!--
TODO: Shall we place the burden of copying (= uploading the JAR)
on the launcher-plugin + Java runtime pair?
-->

Launch the service:

```shell
python -m exonum_launcher -i deploy-start-config.yml
```

Launcher will take the service instance name and other parameters from
the configuration file, and submit the request to the node.
The launcher must print the status of the service artifact deploy
and the service instance start.
We can also verify that both operations succeeded via the node API:

```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/services/supervisor/services | jq
```

#### Invoke the Service Operations

We will use a light client application to invoke the service operations.
Development of service client applications is not covered in this tutorial,
but the client for the car registry is provided in the tutorial
repository as a third module, `car-registry-client`.

If you have not cloned the repository already, clone it and build the client:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:exonum/exonum-java-binding.git
cd exonum-java-binding/exonum-java-binding/tutorials/car-registry
mvn package -pl car-registry-client -am
```

Check it is built successfully:

```shell
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar -h
```

First, generate an Ed25519 key pair, that the client will use to sign
the transactions to our service:

```shell
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  keygen
```

Now, try to submit transactions adding your own vehicles to the blockchain:

```shell
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  add-vehicle -a -n=test-car-registry "My car" "VW" "Polo" "$USER"
```

`-a` option requests the client to _await_ the transaction commitment, so that
we can see its execution result; `-n` specifies the service instance _name_
that we assigned on its start.

Check they are in the registry:

```shell
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  find-vehicle -n=test-car-registry "My car"
```

Suppose for a minute, that Emmett Brown has got tired of time travels,
and decided to transfer his DeLorean to you:

```shell
# Check the entry beforehand
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  find-vehicle -n=test-car-registry "V2"

# Change the owner to the current user
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  change-owner -a -n=test-car-registry "V2" "$USER"

# See the updated entry
java -jar car-registry-client/target/car-registry-client-1.0.0.jar \
  find-vehicle -n=test-car-registry "V2"
```

!!! success
    Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a simple Exonum
    service, started a network of nodes, and deployed your application
    in it!

## Exercises

**E1**. The transaction [transferring the ownership over a vehicle](#transfer-the-ownership-transaction)
currently allows transferring it to the same owner
(e.g., "John Doe" > "John Doe"). It also accepts empty owner field.
Modify its code to forbid such input arguments.

**E2**. Try the following sequence of operations with a fresh service state:

1. Change the owner of vehicle "V1" to "John Doe"
2. Change the owner of vehicle "V1" to yourself
3. Change the owner of vehicle "V1" back to "John Doe".

The third operation is expected to be rejected at submission because
the corresponding transaction message is equal to the first
transaction message, which is already committed. Exonum rejects transactions
with the same messages (basically, with same arguments and coming from
the same author) to prevent their replication by another user.
Modify the transaction so that such operation is possible.

??? help "Hint"
    A common approach to make transactions with the same arguments from the
    same author have different messages is to include a _seed_ field. Each
    transaction author will have to set it to a unique value (to that author
    and set of arguments). As a seed, each author may use a counter of submitted
    transactions, or a random value.

    You will also have to modify the client application to test the modified
    service.

**E3**. Add an operation returning all vehicles in the registry.

!!! note
    You will have to modify the service, its API and the client application.
