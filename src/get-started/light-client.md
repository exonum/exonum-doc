# Exonum Light Client Tutorial

!!! note
    Light client is also available in Java language.  
    Please refer to the [readme][lc-java] for details.

In this tutorial we describe how to use the light client to interact with
Exonum services. The tutorial extends other tutorials:
[Cryptocurrency Advanced](data-proofs.md)
and, partly, [Timestamping][timestamping-demo].

Light client is a JavaScript library used for a number of purposes:

- forming and sending transactions to the blockchain
- creating digital signatures over transactions
- obtaining and checking cryptographic proofs of data authenticity and
  integrity.

Below we will provide you with the detailed description of how said
functionality is executed in Exonum light client.

## Before You Start

To start using Exonum light client, include [exonum-client][javascript-client]
into your JavaScript application. Please refer to this detailed guide
for instructions on how to customize your client. The present tutorial will
show you the ready-made examples of the client use.

## Execute a Transaction

A transaction is an atomic operation that introduces changes to the blockchain
state. The structure, contents and number of transaction types within one
service vary depending on the business logic of each service.

The general algorithm of executing a transaction in Exonum includes several
stages:

- define a schema of the transaction payload with Protobuf
- generate a signing key pair (if required)
- define a transaction schema
- define transaction data
- sign the transaction
- send transaction to the blockchain.

Below we provide two peculiar examples of transaction execution in Exonum
services based on the
[Cryptocurrency Advanced Service][cryptocurrency-advanced] and
the [Timestamping Service][timestamping].

As mentioned above, Exonum light client uses Protobuf as data serialization
format. For this purpose [protobufjs][protobufjs-lib] library is applied. With
this library you can describe data either through `.proto` files or with the
help of the built-in reflection methods.

The first method presupposes that the transaction schema is initially defined
in a `.proto` file. And then a corresponding `.js` file called stub is generated
out of said `.proto` file.

In the reflection method the .proto definitions are directly reflected in
JavaScript.

Below, with the demonstration purpose we define the data schema of the
timestamping transaction with the help of both methods. For the transfer funds
transaction from the Cryptocurrency Advanced Service, only `.proto` files are
used as this method is more common for Exonum services.

### Example of the Timestamping Transaction

#### Define a Schema of the Transaction Payload with Protobuf

As stated in our [Guide for the Light Client][javascript-client-nested-types],
a custom data type can be a field of other custom data type without limitation
as to the depth of the nested data.

In the Timestamping Service we start defining the transaction with the data
types used within the `TxTimestamp` entity. Said entity is further
applied as a custom type within `CreateTimestamp` transaction schema.

In our Timestamping Service we have the following structures:

- `Hash` is an object type with the following field:
    - `data` is an object with SHA-256 hash of some timestamped file
- `Timestamp` is an object of timestamp itself, which contains two fields:
    - `content_hash` is an object of `Hash` type
    - `metadata` is an optional description of the timestamped file
- `TxTimestamp` is a custom object type with the following field:
    - `content` is an object of `Timestamp` type.

##### `.proto` Files Method

Below is an example of the `timestamping.proto` file describing the data
schema of the timestamping transaction in the Protobuf format:

```proto
package timestamping;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message Hash { bytes data = 1; }

// Stores content hash and some optional content metadata.
message Timestamp {
  Hash content_hash = 1;
  string metadata = 2;
}

// Timestamping transaction.
message TxTimestamp { Timestamp content = 1; }
```

When the `.proto` file is ready, generate the `*.js` stub file with
[pbjs][pbjs-lib] library as follows:

```bash
pbjs --keep-case -t static-module timestamping.proto -o ./proto.js
```

This command can be added into `scripts` section of your `package.json`
for further build automatization.

##### Reflection Method

The same schema, as produced above, is represented below with the help of
JavaScript reflections of .proto definitions:

```javascript
const { Root, Type, Field } = protobuf

const root = new Root().define("timestamping")

const Hash = new Type("Hash").add(new Field("data", 1, "bytes"))
root.add(Hash)

const Timestamp = new Type("Timestamp")
  .add(new Field("content_hash", 1, "timestamping.Hash"))
Timestamp.add(new Field("metadata", 2, "string"))
root.add(Timestamp)

const TxTimestamp = new Type("TxTimestamp")
  .add(new Field("content", 1, "timestamping.Timestamp"))
root.add(TxTimestamp)
```

#### Generate a Signing Key Pair

Generate a signing key pair for signing and sending the transaction. The public
key forms a separate field in the transaction header.

```javascript
const keyPair = Exonum.keyPair()
```

!!! note
    In our Timestamping Service we generate a new signing key pair for each new
    timestamp. On the contrary, in the Cryptocurrency Advanced Service we
    generate only
    one key pair that corresponds to a certain wallet and its user and, thus, is
    applied for signing all transactions made on its behalf.

#### Define a Transaction Schema

Define `CreateTimestamp` transaction schema and its field types:

```javascript
const CreateTimestamp = Exonum.newTransaction({
   author: keyPair.publicKey,
   service_id: 130,
   message_id: 0,
   schema: timestamping.TxTimestamp
})
```

- `author` is author’s public key
- `service_id` represents the identifier of the service. Check the identifier
  in the source code of the service (the smart-contract designed in Rust or
  Java)
- `message_id` represents the identifier of the transaction type in the
  service. Corresponds to the index number of the transaction in the service
  source code. Enumeration starts with `0`
- `schema` schema of the `TxTimestamp` type defined above.

#### Define Transaction Data

Prepare transaction data according to the above-defined schema:

```javascript
const data = {
  content: {
    content_hash: { data: Exonum.hexadecimalToUint8Array(hash) },
    metadata: metadata
  }
}
```

#### Sign the Transaction

Sign the transaction with the secret key from the key pair generated above:

```javascript
const signature = CreateTimestamp.sign(keyPair.secretKey, data)
```

#### Send the Transaction

Finally, send the resulting transaction into the blockchain using the built-in
`send` method which returns a `Promise`:

```javascript
const transactionHash = await CreateTimestamp.send(
  transactionEndpoint, data, keyPair.secretKey)
```

- `transactionEndpoint` represents API address of the transaction handler in the
  blockchain explorer of a node. Example:

    ```none
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/api/explorer/v1/transactions
    ```

### Example of the Transfer Funds Transaction

To execute this type of transaction you need to have two wallets
created in advance: a sender and a receiver. You should also generate a separate
key pair for each wallet, so that these keys could be used for defining and
signing the transfer transactions between the wallets.

Now, define `TransferFunds` transaction schema and data types as we did in the
example above.

#### Define a Schema of the Transaction Payload with Protobuf

In the transfer funds transaction we have only one entity - `TransferFunds` -
that has two fields:

- `amount` which represents the amount of transferred tokens
- `seed` which represents a random number that guarantees non-idempotence of
  transactions.

!!! note
    As you might know from our very first tutorial
    [Cryptocurrency Tutorial](create-service.md),
    in order to transfer funds from one wallet to another, a `seed` is included
    into each such transaction. This prevents transactions from being hacked by
    a third person. You can generate `seed` as follows:

      ```javascript
      const seed = Exonum.randomUint64()
      ```

Below is an example of the `example.proto` file describing the data schema of
the transfer funds transaction in the Protobuf format:

```proto
package examples;

message TransferFunds {
  uint64 amount = 1;
  // Auxiliary number to guarantee non-idempotence of transactions.
  uint64 seed = 2;
}
```

As the `.proto` file is ready, generate the `*.js` file as follows:

```shell
pbjs --keep-case -t static-module example.proto -o ./proto.js
```

#### Define a Transaction Schema

Define `TransferFunds` transaction schema and its field types:

```javascript
import * as proto from 'stubs.js'

const TransferFunds = Exonum.newTransaction({
   author: publicKey,
   service_id: 128,
   message_id: 1,
   schema: proto.exonum.examples.cryptocurrency_advanced.Transfer
})
```

The fields are the same as for the `CreateTimestamp` transaction. You can find
their description in the corresponding [section above](#define-a-transaction-schema).

#### Define Transaction Data

Prepare the transaction data according to the above-defined schema. Note that we
identify the sender by the public key of his wallet. The wallet keys must be
generated in advance, when creating said wallet:

```javascript
const data = { amount, seed }
```

#### Sign and Send the Transaction

Now you can sign the transaction with the sender’s secret key and send the
resulting
transaction into the blockchain. The methods applied in this case are identical
to those shown in the `CreateTimestamp` transaction described above.

## Cryptographic Proofs

The idea behind this functionality is one of the core features of the light
client. Whenever you want to check the presence of some data in the blockchain,
a request is made with the light client. The response to the request should
contain your data together with either a cryptographic proof for it or a
corresponding error, if such data is absent in the blockchain for some reason.

In other words, a [cryptographic proof](../glossary.md#merkle-proof)
is a response to the read request made through the light client that:

- validates authenticity of the data included therein
- certifies that said data is safely stored in the blockchain.

In the same way as transactions, data proofs provided by Exonum light client
have a general common structure and comprise several parts. Meanwhile,
depending on the service business logic some extra custom parts may be included
therein.

Below, we will discuss the proof from the Service with Data Proofs which in its
structure repeats the proofs from the Timestamping Demo service plus contains
some custom parts.

The proof itself comprises several levels and, when executed, unfolds from the
highest level down to the lowest one. These levels are represented by the
requested data. The highest level, evidently, corresponds to the blockchain
state hash.

Below is the proof chart representing the proof structure. You can refer to it
while we will be further conducting the proof analyses.

![proof-chart](../images/proof-chart.png)

Thus, first of all, we check that the block containing our data is correct and
bears the state hash indicated in the proof. For this purpose we load the actual
list of public keys of validator nodes stored in the network
[configuration](../architecture/configuration.md). The keys
are applied to assert that the data received from the
blockchain was indeed agreed upon by all the member nodes in the network:

```javascript
const response = await axios.get(
  '/api/services/configuration/v1/configs/actual')
const validators = response.data.config.validator_keys.map(
  validator => validator.consensus_key)
```

Now make a request for the data on a particular wallet together with its proof.
Note, that we identify the wallet by its public key which is in fact the public
key of its holder:

```javascript
const response = await axios.get(
  `/api/services/cryptocurrency/v1/wallets/info?pub_key=${publicKey}`)
// response.data contains the wallet together with its proof
```

- `publicKey` - public key of the wallet of interest.

As soon as we get the data, as mentioned above, we verify the block where it is
stored, in particular block precommits according to the downloaded set of
keys of the validators:

```javascript
if (!Exonum.verifyBlock(data.block_info, validators)) {
  throw new Error('Block can not be verified')
}
```

Next, we need to obtain the root hash of the table that bears all the
registered wallets. This root hash is stored in the table of hashes of
all the tables defined in the service (state hash aggregator). Thus, we check
the presence of the wallets table in the service:

```javascript
const tableRootHash = Exonum.verifyTable(data.wallet_proof.to_table,
  data.block_proof.block.state_hash, SERVICE_ID, TABLE_INDEX)
```

The next proof level is devoted to the validation of existence of a particular
wallet inside the system.

First, we define the structure that we search for in the proof in the Protobuf
format. In this case, it is a wallet.

```proto
package examples;

message Hash { bytes data = 1; }

message PublicKey { bytes data = 1; }

// Wallet information stored in the database.
message Wallet {
  // Public key of the wallet.
  PublicKey pub_key = 1;
  // Name of the wallet.
  string name = 2;
  // Current balance of the wallet.
  uint64 balance = 3;
  // Length of the transactions history.
  uint64 history_len = 4;
  // Hash of the transactions history.
  Hash history_hash = 5;
}
```

```javascript
const { cryptocurrency_advanced } = proto.exonum.examples
const Wallet = Exonum.newType(cryptocurrency_advanced.Wallet)
```

We then obtain the proof down to the required wallet:

```javascript

const walletProof = new Exonum.MapProof(data.wallet_proof.to_wallet,
  Exonum.PublicKey, Wallet)
```

Here we also check that `merkleRoot`, which is now the root hash of the wallets
table, coincides with `tableRootHash` we obtained at the previous level. In this
way we can link two parts of the proof:

```javascript
if (walletProof.merkleRoot !== tableRootHash) {
  throw new Error('Wallet proof is corrupted')
}
```

If the above is the case, we can safely extract wallet data from the proof:

```javascript
const wallet = walletProof.entries.get(publicKey)

if (typeof wallet === 'undefined') {
  throw new Error('Wallet not found')
}
```

Basically, the proof from the Timestamping Service comprises the same validation
levels as described above. Specifically, to obtain confirmation for the
timestamp data, the proof validates the block, the root table and the table of
timestamps. The data on the timestamp can then be extracted from the validated
timestamps table.

Meanwhile, the proof we presently investigate contains another level. This level
refers to the validation of transactions concerning a specific wallet (wallet
history).  

First, we obtain a proof for all transactions in the wallet. It will contain
transactions hashes as well as statuses thereof. In our example we obtain
information for the whole wallet history. However, any suitable
range of the history may be selected:

```javascript

const transactionsMetaData = Exonum.merkleProof(
  Exonum.uint8ArrayToHexadecimal(new Uint8Array(wallet.history_hash.data)),
  wallet.history_len,
  data.wallet_history.proof,
  [0, wallet.history_len],
  Exonum.Hash
)
```

Upon obtainment of the proof, make sure that the number of transactions in the
wallet history, that we extracted earlier together with other information on the
wallet, is equal to the number of transactions in the array of the proof.
Otherwise, transactions cannot be verified against the proof:

```javascript
if (data.wallet_history.transactions.length !==
    transactionsMetaData.length)
{
  throw new Error('Transactions cannot be verified')
}
```

Next, we validate each transaction. For this purpose we iterate them in the
array and check their structure in several steps. This check allows us
to confirm that a transaction of a certain type is present at a definite place
in the array.

In our example, for the sake of brevity, we provide structure
definition of only one transaction type. This type is a transaction of token
issuance from our [Cryptocurrency Advanced Service][cryptocurrency-advanced].
However, note that to perform a real check, all the transaction types of the
service should be defined.

The check of the transaction structure comprises the following steps:

- calculate a hash from the transaction buffer with the `Exonum.hash`
  method. Compare it with the corresponding hash from the array of transaction
  hashes in the proof
- serialize the transaction in its explicit view and compare it with the
  serialized version of the transaction body (buffer without signature). The
  explicit view of the transaction is stored in the `debug` field thereof, while
  the serialized view thereof is stored in the `message` field in the hex format
- validate each transaction signature with the `Transaction.verifySignature`
  method. The required data for validation are signature and author of the
  transaction in the hex format and the transaction data in its explicit view.

Below is an example of the proof check for the transaction history of a wallet:

```javascript
for (let transaction of data.wallet_history.transactions) {
  const hash = transactionsMetaData[index++]
  const buffer = Exonum.hexadecimalToUint8Array(transaction.message)
  const bufferWithoutSignature = buffer.subarray(0, buffer.length - 64)
  const author = Exonum.uint8ArrayToHexadecimal(buffer.subarray(0, 32))
  const signature = Exonum.uint8ArrayToHexadecimal(
    buffer.subarray(buffer.length - 64, buffer.length))

  const Transaction = new Exonum.newTransaction({
    author: author,
    service_id: SERVICE_ID,
    message_id: TX_WALLET_ID,
    schema: proto.exonum.examples.cryptocurrency_advanced.Issue
  })

  // Calculate a hash from the transaction body and compare it with the
  // corresponding hash in the array of transaction hashes.
  if (Exonum.hash(buffer) !== hash) {
     throw new Error('Invalid transaction hash')
  }

  // Serialize transaction from the debug view and compare it with the
  // `bufferWithoutSignature` obtained above.
  if (!Transaction.serialize(transaction.debug)
    .every((el, i) => el === bufferWithoutSignature[i])) {
    throw new Error('Invalid transaction message')
  }

  // Validate the transaction signature.
  if (!Transaction.verifySignature(signature, author, transaction.debug)) {
     throw new Error('Invalid transaction signature')
  }
}
```

service through the light client so far.

Well done! You have now equipped your application with a full-stack Exonum-based
support! At this the point you can build and run your application.
