# What is Exonum

Exonum is an extensible framework for blockchain software projects. Whether you want to make a supply chain solution or a land registry notarization, coupons market or electronic auction, procurement or P2P lending platform, Exonum provides you with all the necessary blockchain functionality. Simply add your business logic and you're ready to go.

## Blockchain features

Blockchain used as a data storage provides some key features:
1. History saving. As the blockchain saves all transactions that change data state, we can always restore all history for every item in the data storage.
2. Immutability. Data cannot be changed retroactively. No old transactions can be replaced or removed. 
3. Distribution. Every node has its own copy of blockchain. If some nodes would be broken, the network itself will prolong its activity. 
4. Consistency. New changes to data storage are approved by consensus of nodes. All nodes have just one blockchain state. If a node falls far behind it can easily and unequivocally reload new blocks.

To get more info about blockchain structure, nodes, blocks and transactions, please refer to **TODO: link. read more about blockchain. Design overview?**

## Bitcoin and blockchain

Bitcoin is the most famous, most stable product used a blockchain technology. However Exonum allows you to create new projects not limited to the cryptocurrency thematic. Different projects and applications are represented in the Demos section: **TODO: link to the demos**. Of course, cryptocurrency can be created too:)

## Exonum features

### Smart contracts

Exonum allows uniting your business logic with blockchain advantages. As it works with "data storage" and "transactions" on the high-level of abstraction, you may implement any functionality you need. For now, the custom logic should be included in the built binaries and so distributed among nodes.
To create project with Exonum, you should implement the following pieces of code:

1. Data storage schema. What should Exonum save?
2. Transactions executing procedure. What atomic transactions could be? How do they change the data?

That's all, your first application is ready.

Though the previous steps are necessary, you save all the control over the network. You may add different handlers for events, such as block commitment, transaction executing, and so on.

All the outer applications may communicate with Exonum blockchain through REST API written on [IRON](http://ironframework.io/). That is, you may implement API endpoints for every type of query your application need in. For example, for cryptocurrency you may add endpoints like this:

- `/getbalance?address=AAA` reads the current balance for the certain address;
- `/send?from=AAA&to=BBB&sum=100` creates Exonum transaction and broadcasts it to the blockchain network

In addition, you may refer to our demos and tutorials that show the process step by step: **TODO: link to tutorials**

### Private blockchain

Exonum builds a partly private blockchain. It means that only the limited list of nodes can generate new blocks. 
While business transactions can be generated by any appropriate node, the restricted list of nodes called validators gather them and generate new block. Validators check every transaction and decide which of them should be applied to the real data storage.

Validators sign every block. Consensus between validators is necessary for the new block to be approved; so, nobody can create a fake or parallel version of the blockchain. 

Normally there should be 4-15 validators.

### Byzantine Consensus

Exonum uses custom modification of Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) Consensus between validators. The main advantage of our consensus is that the network would proceed with a correct work even if up to 1/3 validators are hacked, broken or just turned off. If malefactor takes control over any node (or several nodes), it can not break the data or even stop the service. If some validators are stopped for the maintenance, the network behaves correctly.

### Technical characteristics

The Core is written on the RUST that is safety-oriented language. It is compiled for LLVM, so it can be built for almost every operational system. From other side, compiled code is quick as native one.

The service built over the Exonum Core can handle 7000 transactions per second, with a clearance time about 2.5 sec.
Normally you may want to generate new block each 1-10 seconds. The recommended hardware requirements for a validator are:

 - **TODO: system requirements for validator**
 - hdd ?
 - network ?
 - CPU ?
 - RAM ?
 
Exonum Core is released under the Apache 2.0 **TODO: is it correct?** open source license. You may use it free with respect to the license conditions.
