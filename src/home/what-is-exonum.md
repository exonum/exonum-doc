# What is Exonum

Exonum is a framework to build applications on the blockchain. It is written in Rust and should be linked to your application as as a library using rust calls or java bindings.

## Blockchain features

Blockchain used as a data storage provides some key features:
1. History saving. As the blockchain saves all transactions that change data state, we can always restore all history for every item in the data storage.
2. Immutability. Data can not be changed retroactively. No old transactions can be replaced or removed. 
3. Distribution. Every node has its own copy of blockchain. If some nodes would be broken, the network itself will prolong its activity. 
4. Consistency. New changes to data storage are approved by consensus of nodes. All nodes have just one blockchain state. If a node falls far behind it can easily and unequivocally reload new blocks.

To get more info about blockchain structure, nodes, blocks and transactions, please refer to **TODO: link. read more about blockchain. Design overview?**

## Bitcoin and blockchain

Bitcoin is the most famous, most stable product used a blockchain technology. However Exonum allows you to create new projects not limited to the cryptocurrency thematics. Different projects and applications are represented in the Demos section: **TODO: link to the demos**. Of course, cryptocurrency can be created too:)

Биткоин - это единый продукт, сделанный на блокчейне. Exonum же позволяет создавать на базе блокчейна различные продукты, в том числе и криптовалюту. Пример вы можете посмотреть в **TODO: ссылка на демо криптовалюты**. Более того, вы можете реализовать любую другую бизнес-логику, которая вам нужна.


## Exonum features

### Smart contracts

Exonum allows to unite your business logic with blockchain advantages. As it works with "data storage" and "transactions" on the high-level of abstraction, you may implement any functionality you need. For now, the custom logic should be included in the built binaries and so distributed among nodes.
To create project with Exonum, you should implement the following pieces of code:

1. Data storage schema. What should exonum save?
2. Transactions executing procedure. You may create different types of the transactions that posess different logic.
3. Any optional handlers on block commitement, transaction executing, etc. **TODO: is it so? anything else?**

Also, you may refer to our demos and tutorials that shows the process step by step: **TODO: link to demos**

### Private blockchain

Exonum builds a partly-private blockchain. It means that new blocks can be generated by the limited list of nodes only. 
While business transactions can be generated by any appropriate node, the restricted list of nodes called validators gather them and generate new block. Validators check every transaction and decide which of them should be applied to the real data storage.  
Every block is signed by the validators. Consenus between validators is neccessary for the new block to be approved; so, nobody can create a fake or parallel version of the blockchain.  
Normally there should be 4-15 validators.

### Bysantine Consensus

Exonum uses custom modification of Bysantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) Consensus between validators. The main advantage of our consensus is that the network would proceed correct work even if up to 1/3 validators are hacked, broken or just turned off. If malefactor takes control over any node (or several nodes) it can not break the data or even stop the service. If some validators are stopped for the maintenance, the network behaves correctly.

Let us have 13 validators.

#### 1-4 validators are hacked

If less than `1/3` of validators are hacked, then it does not matter. Of course it may decrease speed of the whole network (as if these validators are just turned off), but it gives no critical influence.

#### 5-8 validators are hacked

At least `1/3` validators need to be hacked for service to be stopped. However no data can be broken; no fake blocks can be generated, no fake transactions can be approved.

#### 9-13 validators are hacked

If hacker takes control over more than `2/3` of validators, he may approve incorrect transactions. However any honest full-node can check it and alarm if some inconsistency is found.

The mathematical proof of such liveness is described in the our whitepaper: **TODO: link to whitepaper**. Also you may read more at **TODO: design overview link**.

### Technical characteristics

The Core is written on the RUST that is safety-oriented language. It is compiled for LLVM, so it can be built for almost every operational system. From other side, compiled code is quick as native one.

The service built over the Exonum Core can handle a 7000 transactions per second, with a clearance time about 2.5 secs.
Normally you may want to generate new block each 1-10 seconds. The recommended hardware requirements for a validator are:
 - **TODO: system requirements for validator**
 - hdd ?
 - network ?
 - CPU ?
 - RAM ?
 
The code of Exonum Core is openly distributed under Apache 2.0 **TODO: we do not change it? maybe, modifications?** license. You may use it freely with respect to the license agreement.
