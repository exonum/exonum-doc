# Transactions

A transaction in a Blockchain (as in usual databases) is a group of sequential
operations with the database, which is a logical unit of work with data. So any
business logic of the project with Exomum should be formulated using different
types of transactions. A transaction can be executed either entirely and successfully,
respecting the integrity of the data and regardless of the other transactions going
in parallel, or not performed at all, and then it should not have any effect. A
transaction could be created by the allowed entities (for example, a private key
owner could initialize its coins transfer for cryptocurrency) and send for the distributed
system of validators for the consideration. Â If the transaction is correct, it would
be included in a block of the Blockchain throw the validators voting process via
the Consensus algorithm work.

A transaction consists of

1. `service_id`: sets the **TODO** ref service to make a deal with (for example,
configuration or cryptocurrency). All the transactions are stored in the Blockchain
sequentially. But such a manner is not useful for queries. So any fat client also
duplicates information from the Blockchain in the special databases (one per service)
those support queries and also provides proofs of consistency with the Blockchain
(see **TODO** ref Merkle index and ref Merkle Patricia index.
2. `message_id`: the nodes of the Blockchain network sends and receives messages
to communicate. The message id defines the message type. For the transaction, it
means the type of transaction in the service. For example, service *cryptocurrency*
could include different types of transactions: `AddFundsTransaction` for coins emission
and `TransferTransaction` for money transfer et. al.
3. `body`: the body of the transaction, which includes specific for the given transaction
type (`message_id`) data. For example, the body of `TransferTransaction` should
include field `from` for coins sender, `to` for coins recipient, `amount` for the
sending amount and `seed` to distinct different transactions with the same previous
three fields
4. `signature`: the cryptographic signature for the message with a transaction.
Any author of the transaction (as any other message) should have the private and
public keys which allow him to generate a correct transaction. He shouldn't provide
any other person his private key but should use it to sign messages. And any other
could check if the author signed the message using public key and signature.

The main properties of Blockchain transactions are

1. *purity*: the right to send transaction could be checked no matter the transaction
source using cryptography
2. *sequential consistency*: any valid copy of the Blockchain has the same order
of blocks and transactions in it. Such a property is guaranteed by the **TODO** ref
Consensus algorithm
3. *non-replayability*: any transaction could be included into the Blockchain only
once. The `seed` field inside the transaction and ignoring the already included
into the Blockchain transactions for the new blocks guarantees it.
